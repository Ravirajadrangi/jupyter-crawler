      "{u'content': u'\\nA: I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan. As I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis, we\\u2019re obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods. We don\\u2019t want to have to be looking at redundancies. So, we\\u2019ve outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.\\nB: We have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.\\nC: Why would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.\\nB: Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead timesfor better overall efficiency.\\nA: Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.\\nC: I see& That makes sense.\\nB: The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.\\nC: I\\u2019m with you on this one. Its essential that we reduce these errors; we\\u2019ve got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.\\nA: Exactly. Well, let\\u2019s look at how we\\u2019re going to put this plan into action.

I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft skills; you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team solved about seventy percent of our customers\\u2019 problems. I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers\\u2019 issues. Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.\\nA: Impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?\\nB: To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to organize my time efficiently. I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I\\u2019m getting better now.\\nA: Great...
